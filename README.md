# ♫ About Xylophone
Xylophone is a musical instrument that anyone can play! Just tap different colored bars on the screen and enjoy.

## Description
This application was created during ["The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/). Its layout was created from scratch. AVFoundation was used to play sound, also I saved sound playback in silent mode.
